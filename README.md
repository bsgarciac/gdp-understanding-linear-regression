# GDP Understanding Using Linear Regression Model

![GDP](data/gdp-min.jpg)

This project aims to build a predictive model for a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) based on several economic and social indicators. Linear regression is employed to establish a relationship between these indicators and the GDP.

## Overview

In this project, we use Python with Scikit-learn to build a linear regression model for GDP prediction. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique for modeling relationships between a target variable (in this case, GDP) and one or more independent variables (economic indicators).

## Data Sources

Our analysis is based on datasets taken from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib 
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the jupyter notebook **analysis.ipynb** to explore the exploratory data analysis. 
3. Open and run the jupyter notebook **regression.ipynb** to review the model training and testing.
4. Take a look into **results.pdf** to get a summary of the conclusions achieved.
